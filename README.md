## My process

1.- Gathered the fonts and colors to be used in the entire project.

4.- Gave styles to the sections with pure css and flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Scaled to desktop version

### What I learned

How to improve lighthouse scores by paying attention to accesibility.
How the contraste and fonts are really important and need to be paid attention at in everytime.


### Continued development
